    - Server and web browser communicate via HTTP protocol
    - In traditional web apps, browser would request HTML from server and all application logic is on the server.
        - Apps would also make all new requests (html, css, javascript) each time a DOM element changed dynamically.
    - In modern SPA's only one request is sent to server
